## Usage

![Nodegate usage](docs/assets/images/readme-schema.png)

This plugin will help you to solve the well known problem of [API management][url-wiki-api-management].
Some people are doing this by themselves, others by using complex tools or services. But even with
this kind of systems you will have to program some mechanics. Nodegate helps you to
programmatically configure, develop and run your API gateway, in the simple way.

> Everything can be done by declaring routes with a workflow containing workers. Each worker
> _modify_ a container for composing the response. That's it.

A bunch of workers are bundled with this plugin, but everyone can create more easily!
